Video (v1)
====
Video component written in HTL that renders a video reference using the standard html5 player

## Features
* allows enabling or disabling autoplay, loop, user controls, sound
* allows poster image to be used as placeholder when video is loading

### Use Object
The Video component uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.Video` Sling model as its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Video component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./fileReference` - property or `file` child node - will store either a reference to the video file
2. `./posterFileReference` - property or `file` child node - will store either a reference to the image file, or the image file
3. `./loopEnabled` - defines whether the video should loop from the start when playback is finished
4. `./hideControl` - defines whether video controls should be hidden for the user
5. `./autoplayEnabled` - defines whether the video should autoplay. Forces mute to be also se to true.
6. `./mutedEnabled` - defines whether the video sound should be muted. It cannot be disabled if autoplay is set to true, because of browsers only allowing autoplay if the video is muted.
